      <statement>
        <p>An equation in the unknowns <m>x,y,z,\ldots</m> is called <term>linear</term> if both sides of the equation are a sum of (constant) multiples of <m>x,y,z,\ldots</m>, plus an optional constant.</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>For instance,
    <me>
      \begin{split}
      3x + 4y &amp;= 2z \\
      -x - z &amp;= 100
      \end{split}
    </me>
    are linear equations, but
    <me>
      \begin{split}
      3x + yz &amp;= 3 \\
      \sin(x) - \cos(y) &amp;= 2
      \end{split}
    </me>
    are not.</p>

    <p>We will usually move the unknowns to the left side of the equation, and move the constants to the right.
    </p>

    <p>A <term>system</term> of linear equations is a collection of several linear equations, like

    </definition>

    <p> In the previous chapter, we encountered vector equations. It turns out that vector equations are simply systems
    of linear equations in different notation. We'll give two examples to show this is the case.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Convert the vector equation
	  <me>x\vec{1 2 6}
    + y \vec{-1 -2 -1}
	  = \vec{8 16 3},</me>
	   to a system of linear equations.
	</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
	<p>
	  Using the rules for scalar multiplication of vectors, the equation turns into
	  <me>\vec{1x 2x 6x}
	  + \vec{-1y -2y -1y}
	  = \vec{8 16 3}. </me>
	  We can tidy this up a bit to
	  <me>\vec{x 2x 6x}
	  + \vec{-y -2y -y}
	  = \vec{8 16 3}. </me>
	  Then using the rules for addition of vectors, it turns into
	   <me>\vec{x-y 2x-2y 6x-y}
	   = \vec{8 16 3}. </me>
	   Which is the same as the system of linear equations
	   <me> \syseq{x-y=8; 2x-2y=16; 6x-y=3\rlap.}</me>
	</p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement><p>Convert the system <me> \syseq{x+y=1; y+z=2; z+x=3.}</me>
      into a vector equation.
      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
	<p>The way this system is written has the disadvantage that the variables are not in a consistent order, and
	also that not all variables appear in each equation. You can rewrite it as
	<me>\syseq{1x+1y+0z=1; 0x+1y+1z=2; 1x+0y+1z=3,}
	</me>
	and you can write this as an equation of vectors
	<me>\vec{1x+1y+0z 0x+1y+1z 1x+0y+1z} = \vec{1 2 3}.
	</me>
	Using the rules for addition of vectors, you can rewrite the equation as
	<me> \vec{1x 0x 1x} + \vec{1y 1y 0y} + \vec{0z 1z 1z} = \vec{1 2 3} </me>
	and then using scalar multiplication you can convert this to the vector equation
	<me> x\vec{1 0 1}+y\vec{1 1 0}+z\vec{0 1 1} = \vec{1 2 3}.</me>
	</p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    
    
    <p>
      A system of linear equations need not have a solution. We have already seen an example of this in vector notation (<xref ref="vector-equation-example-inconsistent"/>) . Here is
      another example: there do not exist numbers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> making the following two equations true simultaneously:
      <me>
        \syseq{x + 2y = 3 ; x + 2y = -3\rlap.}
      </me>
      In this case, the solution set is <em>empty</em>, and the system is said to be <term>inconsistent</term>.
    </p>

      <idx><h>Consistent</h><see>System of linear equations</see></idx>
      <idx><h>Inconsistent</h><see>System of linear equations</see></idx>
      <statement>
        <p>A system of linear equations is called <term>inconsistent</term> if it has no solutions. It is called
	<term>consistent</term> if it has at least one solution.</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>This definition exactly matches the definition for vector equations (<xref
    ref="dimension-consistent-inconsistent"/>). A system of linear equations is consistent exactly when the associated
    vector equation is.</p>

        A solution to the <em>system</em> of both equations is a pair of numbers <m>(x,y)</m> that makes both equations true at once.  In other words, it as a point that lies on both lines simultaneously.  We can see in the picture above that there is only one point where the lines intersect: therefore, this system has exactly one solution.  (This solution is <m>(3,2)</m>, as the reader can verify.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Usually, two lines in the plane will intersect in one point, but of course this is not always the case.  Consider now the system of equations
        <me>\def\r{\color{seq-violet}}\def\b{\color{seq-green}}
        \syseq{\r x \r- \r3y \r= \r-3; \b x \b- \b3y \b= \b3\rlap.}</me>
        These define <em>parallel</em> lines in the plane.

          <![CDATA[

    \draw[grid lines] (-20,-20) rectangle (20,20);

  \end{tikzpicture}
          ]]>
        </latex-code>
        The fact that that the lines do not intersect means that the system of equations has no solution.  Of course, this is easy to see algebraically: if <m>x-3y=-3</m>, then it is cannot also be the case that <m>x-3y=3</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is one more possibility.  Consider the system of equations
        <me>\def\r{\color{seq-violet}}\def\b{\color{seq-green}}
        \syseq{\r x \r- \r3y \r= \r-3; \b2x \b- \b6y \b= \b-6\rlap.}</me>
        The second equation is a multiple of the first, so these equations define the <em>same</em> line in the plane.
        <latex-code>
          <![CDATA[
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.2]
    \draw[grid lines] (-20,-20) rectangle (20,20);
    \clip (-20,-20) rectangle (20,20);
    \draw[->] (-20,0) -- (20,0);
    \draw[->] (0,-20) -- (0,20);
    \draw[seq-green, double=seq-violet!50, double distance=1pt, thick] (-20,-20/3+1) -- (20,20/3+1);
  \end{tikzpicture}
          ]]>
        </latex-code>
        In this case, there are infinitely many solutions of the system of equations.

        Each equation individually defines a plane in space.  The solutions of the system of both equations are the points that lie on both planes.  We can see in the picture below that the planes intersect in a line.  In particular, this system has infinitely many solutions.

    <p>
      According to this <xref ref="systems-eqns-soln-sets"/>, solving a system of equations means writing down all solutions in terms of some number of parameters.  We will give a systematic way of doing so in <xref ref="parametric-form"/>; for now we give parametric descriptions in the examples of the previous <xref ref="systems-eqns-pictures"/>.

        Consider the linear equation <m>x+y=1</m> of this <xref ref="systems-eqns-picture-line"/>.  In this context, we call <m>x+y=1</m> an <term>implicit equation</term> of the line.  We can write the same line in <term>parametric form</term> as follows:
        <me>(x, y) = (t,\, 1-t) \sptxt{for any} t \in \R.</me>
        This means that every point on the line has the form <m>(t,\, 1-t)</m> for some real number <m>t</m>.  In this case, we call <m>t</m> a <term>parameter</term>, as it <em>parameterizes</em> the points on the line.
