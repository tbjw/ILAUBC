    <title>Vector Equations</title>

    <p>
      An equation involving vectors with <m>n</m> coordinates is the same as <m>n</m> equations involving only numbers.  For example, the equation
    <men xml:id="vector-equation-first">x\vec{1 2 6} + y \vec{-1 -2 -1} = \vec{8 16 3}</men>
    simplifies to
    <me>\vec{ x 2x 6x} + \vec{-y -2y -y} = \vec{8 16 3}
\sptxt{or}
\spalignsysdelims()\syseq{ x - y; 2x - 2y; 6x - y} = \vec{8 16 3}.
    </me>
    For two vectors to be equal, all of their coordinates must be equal, so this is just the system of linear equations
    <me>\spalignsysdelims\{.\syseq{x - y = 8; 2x - 2y = 16; 6x - y = 3\rlap.}</me>
    </p>

    <definition>
      <idx><h>Vector equation</h><h>definition of</h></idx>
      <statement>
        <p>A <term>vector equation</term> is an equation involving a linear combination of vectors with possibly unknown coefficients.</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    
        <bluebox>
      <p>Asking whether or not a vector equation has a solution is the same as asking if a given vector is a linear combination of some other given vectors.  
      </p>
    </bluebox>
    <p>For example the vector equation above is asking if the vector <m>(8,16,3)</m> is a linear combination of the vectors <m>(1,2,6)</m> and <m>(-1,2,-1)</m>.</p>

    <example xml:id="vector-equation-example-unique">
      <statement>
        <p>Consider the vector equation <me>x\vec{1 1 1 2} + y \vec{0 1 1 0} + z \vec{0 0 1 -1} = \vec{3 -2 4 0}.</me> Can you
	find all solutions to this equation? That is, all possible values for numbers <m>x, y, z</m> that make the
	equation true?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
	<p> The vector equation is the same as
	<me>\vec{x x+y x+y+z 2x-z} = \vec{3 -2 4 0}.</me>
	  We can rewrite the vector equation as four equations that each must be true at the same time:
	  <me> x = 3, \qquad x+y=-2, \qquad x+y+z = 4, \qquad 2x-z=0.</me>
	  So we deduce that <m>x=3</m> must be true from the first equation, then <m>y= -2 -3 = -5</m> from the second
	  and so <m>z=4-3+5=6</m> from the third. The values  <m> x = 3,\, y=-5,\, z=6</m> make the fourth equation work
	  out as well. There is a unique solution: <m> x = 3,\, y=-5,\, z=6</m>.
	</p>
	<p> We can also use vector notation to write this solution as 
	<me>\vec{x y z} = \vec{3 -5 6}.</me>
	</p>
      </solution>
    </example>

      <example xml:id="vector-equation-example-not-unique">
      <statement>
        <p>Consider the vector equation <me>x\vec{1 1 1} + y \vec{0 -1 -1} + z \vec{2 0 0} = \vec{3 1 1}.</me>
	Does this vector equation have a solution? Does it have more than one solution?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
	<p> This vector equation has infinitely many solutions. We will solve equations like this more systematically
	later. For now, let's content ourselves with the observation that no matter what value of <m>z</m> we choose,
	setting <m>x=3-2z</m> and <m>y=2-2z</m> yields a solution, because
	<me> (3-2z) \vec{1 1 1} + ( 2-2z) \vec{0 -1 -1} + z \vec{2 0 0} = \vec{3-2z+2z 3-2z-(2-2z) 3-2z-(2-2z)} = \vec{3
	1 1}</me>
	</p>
	<p>For now, this might look a bit like magic. But you can try for yourself what happens if you set
	<m>z=0</m>, <m>x=3</m> and <m>y=2</m> or <m>z=1</m>, <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=0</m>.
	</p>
      </solution>
      </example>

      <specialcase xml:id="vector-equation-example-inconsistent">
              <p>Consider the vector equation <me>x\vec{1 1 1} + y \vec{0 -1 -1} + z \vec{2 0 0} = \vec{1 3 1}.</me>
	Does this vector equation have a solution? Does it have more than one solution?
        </p> 
	<p> This vector equation does not have any solution. We could write it as three separate equations:
	<me>x+2z=1, \qquad x-y=3, \qquad x-y=1,</me>
	which all have to be true at the same time for a solution <m>x, y, z</m>.
	The second equation says <m>x-y=3</m> and the third says <m>x-y=1</m>. These two statements cannot be true at
	the same time, no matter what values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> we choose. So there can be no solution to the
	vector equation.
	</p>
       </specialcase>

	<p>The above <xref ref="vectors-defn-span"/> is the first of several <em>essential definitions</em> that we will see in this textbook.

All of the definitions are important, but it is essential that you learn and understand the definitions marked as such.

<!--    <p>The thing we really care about is solving systems of linear equations, not solving vector equations.  The

      <p>Below we will show that the above system of equations  is consistent.  Equivalently, this means that the above vector equation  has a solution.  In other words, there is a linear combination of <m>(1,2,6)</m> and <m>(-1,2,-1)</m> that equals <m>(8,16,3)</m>.  We can visualize the last statement geometrically.  Therefore, the following <xref ref="vectors-figure-consistent"/> gives a <em>picture of a consistent system of equations</em>.  Compare with <xref ref="vectors-fig-inconsistent"/> below, which shows a picture of an inconsistent system.

    <p>It will be useful to know what are <em>all</em> linear combinations of a set of vectors <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k</m> in <m>\R^n</m>.  In other words, we would like to understand the set of all vectors <m>b</m> in <m>\R^n</m> such that the vector equation (in the unknowns <m>x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k</m>)
    <me>x_1v_1 + x_2v_2 + \cdots + x_kv_k = b</me>
    has a solution (i.e. is consistent).

      <p>Here are two ways of saying the same thing:
      <ol>
	<li>A vector <m>b</m> is in the span of <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k</m>.</li>
        <li>The vector equation

      <p>Later, in <xref ref="vector-in-span-algorithm"/> we will develop a procedure for answering the question “is <m>b</m> in the span of <m>v_1, v_2, \ldots,

	</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
	<p>This question is asking whether we can find scalars <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> that make the equation
	<me> \vec{3 1 1} = x_1\vec{1 0 0} + x_2\vec{1 1 1} </me>
	hold. We can rearrange this to give
	<me> \vec{3 1 1} = \vec{x_1+x_2 0+x_2 0+x_2},</me>
	which we can rewrite this vector equation as three ordinary equations
	<me> \syseq{x_1+x_2=3; x_2=1; x_2=1\rlap.}</me>
	If we set <m>x_1=2</m> and <m>x_2=1</m>, then the equations are true. Therefore we can write
	<me> \vec{3 1 1} = 2 \vec{1 0 0} + \vec{1 1 1}.</me>
	This shows that <m>\vec{3 1 1}</m> is in <m>\Span\left\{ \vec{1 0 0}, \vec{0 1 1} \right\}</m>.

	</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
	<p>This question is very similar to the last one. Can find scalars <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> that make the equation
	<me> \vec{3 1 0} = x_1\vec{1 0 0} + x_2\vec{1 1 1} </me>

	which we can rewrite this vector equation as three ordinary equations
	<me> \syseq{x_1+x_2=3; x_2=1; x_2=0\rlap.}</me>
	The last two equations here contradict each other. They cannot both be true at the same time. This shows that
